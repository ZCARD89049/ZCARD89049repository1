                Narrative
            </h3>
            <p class="textThing">
                Shadow the Hedgehog is a 2005 action platformer released for GameCube, XBox, and Playstation 2 where the entire game is built upon a theme of choosing between good and evil.

                As such, it has no single defined plot, instead letting you traverse its flowchart of stages toward one of ten endings in a very flexible order<!--, regardless of whether or not the ending makes sense with regards to the path you chose-->.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The game starts with an amnesiac Shadow the Hedgehog, fresh off of his prior appearence in Sonic Heroes, trying to make sense of what he knows and remember who he is.

                During this, an alien race known as the Black Arms starts to invade major cities around the world, their leader Black Doom suddenly appearing before Shadow with cryptic promises of restored memories if Shadow delivers the seven Chaos Emeralds to the Black Arms.

                Soon after, in the first level, typical franchise protaganist Sonic the Hedgehog greets Shadow with a fairly casual<br>
                <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6e188150ca95314dc2ea33a9df627405/6832fad0175ce98f-e9/s400x600/d0022fb5c15c2172bd1dd1753f4013463facb88d.gif" alt="HEY SHADOW LONG TIME NO SEE" width="40%">,<br>
                leaving Shadow  a choice between helping either of the two people who seem to know him, or ignore them both and focus on obtaining the Chaos Emeralds.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The endings that the way you complete each level can lead to vary wildly in result, ranging from Shadow remembering Sonic Adventure 2 and declaring himself protector of the world, to him killing Sonic and declaring his intent to take over or destroy the universe, to even deluding himself into thinking he's a robot duplicate and overthrowing Eggman (a character you can never side with in any ending).

                After obtaining all ten normal endings at least once, you unlock a final level in the level select screen showing him making good on his promise from the True Hero ending and saving the world from a meteoric impact, eradicating the Black Arms in the process.

                Gameplay Mechanics
            </h3>
            <p class="textThing">
                The gameplay of Shadow The Hedgehog primarily builds on the gameplay of its direct predecessor Sonic Heroes, being a speed-focused 3D action platformer with linear stage design and a time-based player ranking system, as well as simple collectables such as invincibility power-ups, extra lives, and Rings that protect you from enemy attacks.

                Most actions the player can perform are similar to those used when controlling Shadow in Sonic Heroes and Sonic Adventure 2, and include standard locomotion, jumps, wall jumps, slides, rolling, homing attacks, the first instance of rail grinding working properly in a Sonic game, a brand new three hit melee combo attack, and a move that lets you travel across lines of Rings at high speed.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                While the game does drop the team-based aspect of Sonic Heroes, Shadow The Hedgehog features plenty of new gameplay mechanics rooted in two main ideas:
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The first idea is the game's main theme of choosing between good and evil, with most levels having a linear main route where you get to the end of the stage as fast as possible and two side missions with very different gameplay goals based on their place in the story, a heavily expanded version of the gameplay of Team Chaotix from Sonic Heroes.

                Additionally, the player has two meters at the top of the screen filled by good and evil actions, such as destroying objects or killing enemies of a particular faction, that let you warp forward in the level or kill every neaby enemy at once depending on which one was filled.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The second idea is answering the question "What if we gave Sonic a gun?" by giving Shadow the ability to steal enemy weapons and use them to hold extended fire-fights with enemies at long range, as long as he has ammo for the weapons he stole.<br>
                <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YnzHByNsofo/sddefault.jpg" alt="HEY SHADOW LONG TIME NO SEE" width="80%"><br>
                The game's two-player battle mode expands this idea slightly further, with each player being able to choose from one of six versions of Shadow, two that can pick up and use any weapon, two that permanently have an infinite ammo machine gun, and two that permanently have a perfect example of how overpowered a rocket launcher can be in a video game if isn't capable of harming the user.
