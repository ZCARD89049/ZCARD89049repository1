                Narrative
            </h3>
            <p class="textThing">
                Shadow the Hedgehog is a 2005 action platformer released for GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 where the entire game is built upon a theme of choosing between good and evil.

                As such, it has no single defined plot, instead letting you traverse its flowchart of stages toward one of ten endings in a very flexible order<!--, regardless of whether or not the ending makes sense with regards to the path you chose-->.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The game starts with an amnesiac Shadow the Hedgehog, fresh off of his prior appearence in Sonic Heroes, trying to make sense of what he knows and remember who he is.

                During this, an alien race known as the Black Arms starts to invade major cities around the world, their leader Black Doom suddenly appearing before Shadow with cryptic promises of restored memories if Shadow delivers the seven Chaos Emeralds to the Black Arms.

                Soon after, in the first level, typical franchise protaganist Sonic the Hedgehog greets Shadow with a fairly casual<br>
                <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/6e188150ca95314dc2ea33a9df627405/6832fad0175ce98f-e9/s400x600/d0022fb5c15c2172bd1dd1753f4013463facb88d.gif" alt="HEY SHADOW LONG TIME NO SEE" width="40%">,<br>
                leaving Shadow  a choice between helping either of the two people who seem to know him, or ignore them both and focus on obtaining the Chaos Emeralds.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The endings that the way you complete each level can lead to vary wildly in result, ranging from Shadow remembering Sonic Adventure 2 and declaring himself protector of the world, to him killing Sonic and declaring his intent to take over or destroy the universe, to even deluding himself into thinking he's a robot duplicate and overthrowing Eggman (a character you can never side with in any ending).

                After obtaining all ten normal endings at least once, you unlock a final level in the level select screen showing him making good on his promise from the True Hero ending and saving the world from a meteoric impact, eradicating the Black Arms in the process.

                Gameplay Mechanics
            </h3>
            <p class="textThing">
                The gameplay of Shadow The Hedgehog primarily builds on the gameplay of its direct predecessor Sonic Heroes, being a speed-focused 3D action platformer with linear stage design and a time-based player ranking system, as well as simple collectables such as invincibility power-ups, extra lives, and Rings that protect you from enemy attacks.

                Most actions the player can perform are similar to those used when controlling Shadow in Sonic Heroes and Sonic Adventure 2, and include standard locomotion, jumps, wall jumps, slides, rolling, homing attacks, the first instance of rail grinding working properly in a Sonic game, a brand new three hit melee combo attack, and a move that lets you travel across lines of Rings at high speed.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                While the game does drop the team-based aspect of Sonic Heroes, Shadow The Hedgehog features plenty of new gameplay mechanics rooted in two main ideas:
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The first idea is the game's main theme of choosing between good and evil, with most levels having a linear main route where you get to the end of the stage as fast as possible and two side missions with very different gameplay goals based on their place in the story, a heavily expanded version of the gameplay of Team Chaotix from Sonic Heroes.

                Additionally, the player has two meters at the top of the screen filled by good and evil actions, such as destroying objects or killing enemies of a particular faction, that let you warp forward in the level or kill every neaby enemy at once depending on which one was filled.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The second idea is answering the question "What if we gave Sonic a gun?" by giving Shadow the ability to steal enemy weapons and use them to hold extended fire-fights with enemies at long range, as long as he has ammo for the weapons he stole.<br>
                <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YnzHByNsofo/sddefault.jpg" alt="HEY SHADOW LONG TIME NO SEE" width="80%"><br>
                The game's two-player battle mode expands this idea slightly further, with each player being able to choose from one of six versions of Shadow, two that can pick up and use any weapon, two that permanently have an infinite ammo machine gun, and two that permanently have a perfect example of how overpowered a rocket launcher can be in a video game if isn't capable of harming the user.

                Character
            </h3>
            <p class="textThing">
                As mentioned in the prior section, this game is a follow up to Sonic Heroes, and the design of Shadow the Hedgehog, as well as the designs of the rest of the cast, remain unchanged from that game, to the point of reusing character models.<br>
                <img src="https://i.redd.it/lmwm0nkzxa531.jpg" alt="Rouge" width="40%"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sonic/images/d/d1/Maria1.png" alt="MariaSA2" width="20%"><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sonic/images/7/7d/Gerald_and_Maria_Photo_Shadow_the_Hedgehog.png" alt="MariaSTH" width="20%"><br>
                A few returning characters, however, do receive new models and designs, in addition to new animations across the cast and the controversial decision to replace the English voice cast from prior games with the dub voice cast of the Sonic X animated series.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                In addition, plenty of new  designs were created for the game for the brand-new Black Arms faction.<br>
                Being aliens from a far off planet bent on both conquering the planet for themselves and eliminating the life already living there, the Black Arms are all given designs that contrast the majority of character and enemy designs seen up to that point in the Sonic franchise.<br>
                <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sonic/images/b/bd/Dolphin_2015-09-05_20-27-45-016.png/revision/latest?cb=20220507193000" alt="Black Doom" width="80%"><br>
                None showcase this better than the leader of the Black Arms, Black Doom.<br>
                Black Doom's design is heavily demonic in nature, full of unnatural anatomy, covered in spikes, robes, and jewelry, and all tied together with a red and black color scheme that contrasts the lighter blue color schemes of major heroes in the plot, such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Maria Robotnik, and the president, while also not being a color scheme seen on many other Sonic characters beyond regular villain Doctor Eggman and the focal point of this game, Shadow the Hedgehog himself. The jewelry, robes, and magical abilities also give Black Doom a subdued 'holy' air, befiting his role in the story of constantly trying to corrupt Shadow the Hedgehog and turn him against the heroes and humanity.

                Game Audio
            </h3>
            <p class="textThing">
                Normally, when a the audio design of a game like this is brought up for examination, the first thing discussed is the music.<br>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NucG0kD3pkg?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
                Like most games in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, the soundtrack for this game is considered of above average quality, with almost every level and boss fight in the game having a unique theme, in addition to a collection of menu themes and plenty of shorter peices for cutscenes and other miscellaneous situations.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                For this game in particular, another topic that could crop up in coversation about it is the already-mentioned decision to replace all English voice actors from prior games with the cast of the Sonic X animated television show.
                Despite the controversy surrounding the re-casts, the majority of the voice acting in this game ranges from adequate to high-quality for the time, and the new voice of Doctor Eggman in particular, Mike Pollock, was beloved enough to keep the job all the way to today, even as the rest of the roles were re-cast around him.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                One aspect of the sound design that most people wouldn't discuss, or even notice, is the actual sound effects, which are all appropriately meaty for the darker tone of the game.
                When most people discuss the sound effects, one of the first things they might mention is how 'edgy' many sound choices are, such as a gunshot noise being used as a selection sound on some of the menus.<br>
                What most people fail to notice about that sound in particular is how well it ties into the actual story:
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The only thing Shadow remembers beyond his own name at the beginning of the game is the death of his friend Maria, and the exact same sound is used for the gun that kills her.

                Platforms and Hardware
            </h3>
            <p class="textThing">
                Shadow the Hedgehog, was designed first and foremost as a multi-platform game, with three main versions of the game being released for the GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2, and the PlayStation 2 version of the game additionally being re-released twice, once packed with Sonic Mega Collection Plus, and once as a digital download on the PlayStation 3 in certain regions.
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The game has quite a few assets and abilities ported from Sonic Heroes, and may share the same engine to ensure the gameplay feels familiar to those following up on Shadow's story from that game.<br>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QYB2Tp2x4E0?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
                This possibility becomes more evident when delving into the unused content for the game, as a few of the test maps even reuse geometry from Sonic Heroes.
                Additionally, some of the new features not in Sonic Heroes have a few glitches associated with them, and a few glitches from Sonic Heroes return with slightly different behavior.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="textThing">
                The various versions of the game have minimal differences, with even very few bug fixes across revisions.
                The primary difference between versions of the game is the available text and voice language options.
                The Xbox version will automatically match the voice and text language to whatever your system settings are currently set to and not let you change them directly, the GameCube version has only one language's voice lines per region while letting you swap the text language freely, and the PlayStation 2 version lets you freely swap out the voice language and the text language independently of one another.
